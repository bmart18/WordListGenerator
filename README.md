# WordListGenerator
Simple program to create a wordlist of US 9 digit phone numbers for a given area code

Give area code in command line arguement, you can do as many as you want just add spaces. It will make a separate list for each one

'''Python areacode.py 167 463 433'''

to combine all into areacodes into one list add -s before adding area codes

'''Python areacode.py -s 167 463 433'''

Good to be used for Aircrack-ng WPA/WPA2 cracking as phone numbers are a common wifi password

Might add more list generators in the future.
