# WordListGenerator
Simple program to create a wordlist of US 9 digit phone numbers for a given area code
Change string for AreaCode to your preferred area code
Good to be used for Aircrack-ng WPA/WPA2 cracking as phone numbers are a common wifi password

Might add more list generators in the future.
